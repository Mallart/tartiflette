# Tartiflette
## What is it ?
 Tartiflette is a **collaborating** project we were given by the IUT Paul Sabatier.
 It's a client program simulating a connection to a database of cheeses, enabling the customer to buy products from the "store" using a Java Application.

*Note:* It's only available in French.

## How was it made ?
This project was made by a team of 4 people, 2 mainly programming and 2 designing and creating the user interface.
We used the WindowBuilder add-on that is an overlay of Java's Swing library in order to make the windows design easier, and standard Java 8 to do the rest of the program (using Java 8 was a recommandation of our school)

## What did we learn ?
By doing this project, we learnt to team work and to design UI with additionnal libraries in Java. That helped us finish the project faster.
